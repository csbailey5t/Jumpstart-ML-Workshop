# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview 
### Learning Goals
We hope that by working through a hands-on example of the utilization of machine learning to answer questions, participants will **develop** a fundamental **understanding** of machine learning's application. Through discussions surrounding the use of machine learning in the library environment, we hope to **motivate** participants' **contextualization** of *how* machine learning can be co-opted in a librarian's workflow.

### Structure
- Conceptual introduction to machine learning
- Hands-on document classification as an example machine learning workflow
- Library applications of machine learning
- Existing resources to further your understanding of machine learning and its applications
